# My Perfectionist VR Setup
I'm a pretty particular person in reality, so it stands to reason I would be about VR as well. This is a comprehensive guide to my VR setup, including some descriptions of how things work and why some things don't.

## Hardware 

### Graphics Card
While much of this guide is centered around software, we need to first talk about hardware. Since we're going for the best here, we're going to need the best GPU. I opt for the top of the line consumer-grade graphics card. For the past decade, that's meant NVIDIA. The 1080 Ti, 2080 Ti, 3090, etc. You can probably get away with whatever the flagship model is for a much better price/performance ratio, but that's not what I'm going for here. A disturbing amount of VRAM is important in VR; some benchmarks show up to 17GB being used in Half Life: Alyx. 

To figure out what the top of the line is at this moment, look at benchmarks from [Gamer's Nexus](https://www.youtube.com/user/GamersNexus). They are the most scientific and methodical players in town.
